# Main Flow
### Begin by drawing a polygonal obstacle, counter-clockwise
### Press n to save current polygon, and begin drawing next
### Once finished drawing obstacles, press n and then s to start drawing robot
### press s to draw a new section of the robot
### press e to choose the goal location
### press r to run RRT
### press p to show path
### press g to go

## q to quit!
